This is a program which solves the Hanoi Puzzle using recursive method.
Code shown here is definitely not the most concise nor optimal approach since most of "things" are objectified.
Number of disks can be esaily changed in the first few lines of code.

I am trying to generalize the program, making it can find a path from any positioning to another one.

You can find more about this puzzle on [Wikipedia: Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi).
